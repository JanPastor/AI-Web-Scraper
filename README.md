## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **LLM Provider** (choose one):
   - **Ollama (Local)**
     - Install from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.ai)
     - Pull the LLaMA 3.1 model:
       ```bash
       ollama pull llama3.1
       ```
   - **OpenAI**
     - Get API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
   - **Anthropic**
     - Get API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)

3. **BrightData Account**
   - Sign up at [BrightData](https://brightdata.com)
   - Get your Scraping Browser WebDriver URL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-web-scraper.git
   cd ai-web-scraper
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Configure your `.env` file with your preferred LLM settings:

```env
SBR_WEBDRIVER=your_brightdata_webdriver_url_here
LLM_TYPE=ollama  # or openai, anthropic
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # if using OpenAI or Anthropic
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1  # or gpt-4, claude-3, etc.
```

**LLM Options:**
- **Ollama**: No API key needed. Use model names like `llama3.1`
- **OpenAI**: Requires API key. Use models like `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Anthropic**: Requires API key. Use models like `claude-3-opus` or `claude-3-sonnet`

**Note:** Make sure to keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control.

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Enter a website URL and click "Scrape Website"

4. Once scraping is complete, you can:
   - View the raw scraped content
   - Ask questions about the content using natural language
   - Get AI-powered analysis of the content

## How It Works

1. **Web Scraping**: 
   - Uses BrightData's Scraping Browser for reliable web access
   - Handles CAPTCHAs automatically
   - Extracts clean text content

2. **Content Processing**:
   - Removes unnecessary HTML and scripts
   - Splits content into manageable chunks
   - Preserves meaningful text structure
   - Displays content in real-time viewer

3. **AI Analysis**:
   - Supports multiple LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Processes content using configured LLM
   - Handles large content through batch processing
   - Provides natural language understanding
   - Extracts specific information based on user queries
   - Offers downloadable results in multiple formats

## Limitations

- Requires a BrightData subscription (free trial available)
- Local LLM performance depends on your hardware 
- Some websites may block automated access (that is what BrightData Webscraping browser is for)
- Content analysis quality depends on the LLM model used

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **LLM Import Errors**: Make sure to install the correct package for your chosen LLM:
  ```bash
  pip install langchain-ollama  # For Ollama
  pip install langchain-openai  # For OpenAI
  pip install langchain-anthropic  # For Anthropic
  ```
- **BrightData Connection Issues**: Verify your SBR_WEBDRIVER URL is correct and subscription is active
- **Model Loading Errors**: Ensure you've pulled the correct model (for Ollama) or have valid API keys (for OpenAI/Anthropic)
